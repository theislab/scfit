class BoundClassSampler(_RunClassSampler):
    """Bind a class sampler's per-batch class schedule onto another obs table.

    For every batch the inner sampler yields, this sampler yields one batch of its own
    ``batch_size`` observations of the matching class, drawn from ``classes_to_bind_on``
    (this sampler's own obs) and read as contiguous chunks. Classes are matched by *label*.

    When the inner balances over several columns (its categories are tuples) you can bind on
    a subset with ``on`` -- a ``dict`` mapping inner tuple positions to ``classes_to_bind_on``
    tuple positions (``{0: 0, 1: 1}``); ``None`` matches the whole label. ``classes_to_bind_on``
    (after ``on`` projection) must be a subset of the inner sampler's
    :attr:`~annbatch.abc.BaseClassSampler.vocab`.

    With no ``classes``, rows of the matched class are drawn uniformly. Passing a secondary
    ``classes`` (a single column, row-aligned with ``classes_to_bind_on``) plus ``class_weights``
    adds conditional sampling: which rows of the matched class are drawn is weighted by the
    secondary class (a non-positive weight excludes it), with ``class_weights`` one flat array
    in ``classes.categories`` order.

    ``batch_size`` must be a multiple of ``chunk_size``; the total is
    ``inner_sampler.n_batches() * batch_size`` (one full batch per inner batch). Every drawable
    run must be at least ``chunk_size`` long (stricter with a secondary ``classes``, since runs
    are then cut on the joint key). Multiple workers are not supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inner_sampler
        Any :class:`~annbatch.abc.BaseClassSampler` (typically a :class:`ClassSampler`) whose
        per-batch class schedule and batch count drive sampling.
    chunk_size, preload_nchunks, batch_size
        Sizing for this sampler; ``batch_size`` must be a multiple of ``chunk_size``.
    classes_to_bind_on
        A :class:`pandas.Categorical`, one entry per observation; matched (via ``on``) to the
        class the inner picks. Its (projected) categories must be a subset of the inner's
        :attr:`~annbatch.abc.BaseClassSampler.vocab`.
    on
        Optional ``dict`` mapping inner tuple positions to ``classes_to_bind_on`` positions.
        ``None`` matches the whole label.
    classes
        Optional secondary single-column :class:`pandas.Categorical`, the same length as
        ``classes_to_bind_on``, for conditional (within-class) sampling.
    class_weights
        Optional weights, one per ``classes.categories``; a non-positive weight excludes that class.
    mask, rng
        Optional observation range and random number generator (independent of the inner's).
