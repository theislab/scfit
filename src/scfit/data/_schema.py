r"""Declarative schema for :class:`~binded.Loader`.

A :class:`Scheme` is a rooted tree of :class:`Node`\\s over named cell *sources* — pure structure
(sources, grouping columns, weights, binds). How each node is *read* (chunk / preload / batch sizes)
lives in a separate :class:`SamplerConfig` passed to the loader, deliberately kept off the ``Node`` so
the same structure can be run with different sampler settings.

Each node partitions its source's cells into **leaves** (unique combinations of ``cols``) with a
per-combination :data:`Weights` mapping. A weight of 0 (or a combination absent from the mapping) is
*excluded* — that IS the selection, native to annbatch's ``ClassSampler``. :class:`Bind` links a
parent to a child on shared columns, so the child is sampled *conditioned* on the parent's values.
See ``README.md`` for the model and the cellflow / sc-flow-tools mapping.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source
        Key into :attr:`Scheme.sources`.
    cols
        Tree levels → leaves are the unique combinations of these columns (over ALL the source's
        cells). These are the grouping/condition columns (cellflow's ``split_covariates`` +
        ``perturbation_covariates`` columns; sc-flow-tools' grouping keys).
    keys
        Representation location(s) to stream, each a loc string — ``"X"`` | ``"obsm/<k>"`` |
        ``"layers/<k>"`` (cellflow's ``sample_rep``) — or the equivalent :mod:`anndata.acc` accessor
        describing the same spot (``A.X`` | ``A.obsm["<k>"]`` | ``A.layers["<k>"]``); accessors are
        normalized to the loc string. A single key streams one rep; a tuple streams SEVERAL **aligned**
        reps of the *same* sampled cells — e.g. the state plus a per-cell continuous condition. The

    Each batch, the child's sampled leaf is derived from the parent's leaf via the ``common`` values
    (parent leaf → shared-column values → matching child leaf). This is the source↔target matching:
    with ``common`` = the context (e.g. cell line), the child (control) is drawn from the *same*
    context as the parent (perturbed) — cellflow's "control = same group", sc-flow-tools'
    ``control_values_dict`` + default same-context coupling.

    Conditioning is **required**: if a parent value has no matching positive-weight child leaf the
    loader raises (no silent fallback). When several child leaves share the bound value — the child
    partitions on columns beyond ``common`` (e.g. child cols ``(a, x)`` bound on ``a``) — one is drawn
    ∝ the child's leaf weights, so ``P(child extra cols | common)`` is weight-controlled. Pass
    ``common=()`` to opt into unconditional child sampling explicitly.

    Matching is thus *select* (the child's per-leaf weights) + *project* (``common``) — nothing more is
    needed. An arbitrary parent-leaf → child-leaf pairing (sc-flow-tools' ``matched_keys``) is not a
    separate mechanism: because it is a function, tag each side with a shared key column (parent cells
    with the child leaf they map to, child cells with their own leaf) and bind on that column.

    every node draws the same number of batches (the root's, derived from its cell count), but a node's

        Rows per emitted batch for this node (target rows for the root; source rows for a bound child).

        deliberately. ``1`` ⇒ per-row reads (any on-disk layout); ``>1`` ⇒ contiguous chunked reads
        (higher throughput on disk), assuming each sampled leaf sits in a contiguous run ≥
        ``chunk_size``. Must divide ``batch_size`` (one category per batch).
    preload_nchunks
        Chunks per annbatch read window. **Required** and explicit — there is no hidden default; set it

    preload_to_gpu
        Whether annbatch keeps the read window on-GPU (needs ``cupy``). :obj:`None` (default) auto-selects
