r"""Declarative, index-free class-mapping sampler over annbatch.

A :class:`Scheme` is a rooted tree of :class:`Node`\\s over named cell sources; each node partitions
its source's cells into leaves (unique column-combinations) with a per-combination weight mapping.
:class:`Loader` streams matched ``{source, target, condition}`` batches — one condition per
batch — where the root's per-batch category is drawn from its weights (annbatch ``ClassSampler``) and
each bound child replays that schedule via an annbatch ``BoundClassSampler`` (matched on the bind's
shared columns) so the loaders zip batch-for-batch. No row indices are exposed: the scheme is
columns / keys / weights.

See ``README.md`` (next to this file) for the model, the sampling schemes, and the mapping to
cellflow and sc-flow-tools use-cases.
