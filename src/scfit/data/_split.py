"""Split a :class:`~binded.Scheme`'s target combinations into named splits — weights-only.

A leaf's weight *is* its selection (weight 0 / absent ⇒ not sampled), so a split just restricts the
root node's weights to a subset of combinations. :func:`split_scheme` returns one :class:`Scheme` per
split, identical to the input but with the root weights restricted; bound children (controls) are
carried through unchanged, since a matched control must stay available in every split. Like CellFlow2's
combination-level splitter (hold out whole conditions, not cells), but on the ``Scheme`` — no cells, no
``DatasetCollection``, no loader.

    Splits are over whole *combinations* of ``split_by`` — combos sharing the same ``split_by`` values
    land in the same split — so entire conditions are held out rather than random cells.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scheme
        The prepared scheme; its ``root`` node's positive-weight combinations are the split universe.
    split_by
        Columns whose unique combinations are partitioned across splits — a subset of the root's
        ``cols``.
    ratios
        ``{split_name: fraction}`` summing to 1.0 (all > 0) — **required**, no default. Insertion order
        defines the split order; the first split is the "training" split that
        :paramref:`force_training_values` forces into.
    force_training_values
        ``{column: value}`` (keys ⊆ ``split_by``): any group matching *any* of these (column, value)
        pairs is forced into the first split, regardless of the shuffle.
    random_state
        Seed for the group shuffle (reproducible).

    Returns
    -------
    ``{split_name: Scheme}`` — each a copy of ``scheme`` with the root node's ``weights`` restricted to
    that split's combinations; every other node (bound children / controls) is carried through
    unchanged.
